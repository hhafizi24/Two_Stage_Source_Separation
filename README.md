# Two-Stage Compression and Source Separation
This repository contains Python code for performing two-stage compression and source separation on EEG data using unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Generalized Eigenvalue Decomposition (GED). This technique aims to compress EEG data while isolating meaningful signal sources to enhance data analysis.
# Data Source
The data used in this code was provided by Dr. Michael X. Cohen. The data is stored in a MATLAB (.mat) file format and contains EEG recordings.
